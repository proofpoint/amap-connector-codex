"""tests/test_lane_instructions.py — the server says which lane it is on, and
a path value it was GIVEN may be written the way a shell would write it.

Two changes, one test file, because both exist for the same reason: the host
adapter was carrying per-sandbox state that the connector could have carried
itself.

LANE. `inbox-mcp-vol` is registered TWICE per sandbox — once on the mail
spool, once on the peer (delegation) spool — and served the same MAIL
instructions to both. The delegation server therefore told the agent that its
inbound was untrusted mail and that unexpected requests should go to the user
"instead of acting on them", which is the opposite of that lane's policy. The
workspace instruction block the adapter merges in was the only thing
correcting it. `$INBOX_LANE` lets the binary say which lane it is serving.

EXPANSION. An MCP registration is JSON read by the host, which expands
nothing, so every directory value had to be a substituted absolute container
path — the reason the adapter carries `__CONTAINER_HOME__` placeholders at
all. Expanding `~` and `$VAR` in a value the process was handed is not a
guessed default; it is spelling a supplied value.

Black-box: both binaries are driven as real subprocesses over stdio JSON-RPC.
